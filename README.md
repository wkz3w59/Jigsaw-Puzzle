This is a playable jigsaw puzzle game.  
You can load your own picture, choose the (approximate) number of pieces and their style.  
You can just download the Jigsaw Puzzle.html file and play it locally on your computer. No library, the only external file is the initial picture, which is optional.  
Warning! Jigsaw Puzzle.html uses a default picture. 
If for any reason, this default picture is no longer available, you can change it by editing the code of function "loadInitialFile".  
If you don't, you just won't display the default picture, but you still will be able to play loading your own image with the menu.
